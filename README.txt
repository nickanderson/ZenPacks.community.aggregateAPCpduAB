This ZenPack aggregates the total AMP load from two APC PDUs.

Example Situation:
1 Rack
2 20A circuits
1 PDU for each circuit.

Each piece of equipment has redundant power supplies and has access to both
legs of power. This allows one circuit to fail without bringing down
equipment. In order to ensure that failure of one circuit does not cause the
second circuit to overload and fail the aggregate AMP load must be monitored.
